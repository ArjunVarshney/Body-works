Or, if you're really psyched up, try and complete each exercise in 60 seconds. You get the idea.",

That means your lower abs and core abdominals come into play, your pelvic muscles are key and your side and front hip flexors are crucial. You learn to exercise total body control in a dynamic movement environment.

The final combo is a workout in itself and it uses the body's weight to add natural power to the final two cross cuts making them truly unstoppable. The final combo can be performed as fast as you can. \n\nOne thing you need to keep in mind with sword workouts is that one side will always be dominant. Having said that this is a challenge you can try. Switch lead hands and see what happens to your coordination (slow down a little in execution a little if you have to). If you do decide to switch you have three options: A. Switch after each rep (for advanced swordsmen only). This means after each rep you switch your lead hand on the sword and the way it uses your muscles. B. Switch halfway (perfect for intermediate swordsmen). get to the halfway mark on the number of reps each time and just switch. C. Switch after each set (perfect to beginners). If you're new to all this, getting through a set allows your muscles to become accustomed to the moves and your mind to mentally learn where everything goes.

They help you twist your body from side to side (and throw a punch or jump over obstacles). Internal Obliques - you do not really see them, but they help bring your body back into alignment every time you twist it in one direction or another. Finally there is the Transverse Abdominis - what we so popularly call \"the core\". These wrap around the spine and provide stability, keep us upright and make sure we don't get back pain from our upright posture.

Howler is definitely one of the latter. Its Level III workout status is deceptive. Bring your knees up to your waist every time you do High Knees, make sure you land on the ball of the foot each time, pump your arms as you run and go as fast as possible in 40 seconds and you realize that this could easily be a Level IV or Level V workout, especially if you add EC.",
